{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Not a watercolor book! Seems like copies imo.", "text": "It is definitely not a watercolor book.  The paper bucked completely.  The pages honestly appear to be photo copies of other pictures. I say that bc if you look at the seal pics you can see the tell tale line at the bottom of the page.  As someone who has made many photocopies of pages in my time so I could try out different colors & mediums that black line is a dead giveaway to me. It\u2019s on other pages too.  The entire book just seems off. Nothing is sharp & clear. There is what looks like toner dust on all the pages making them look muddy.  There are no sharp lines & there is no clear definition.  At least there isn\u2019t in my copy.  And the Coloring Book for Adult on the bottom of the front cover annoys me. Why is it singular & not plural?  They usually say coloring book for kids or coloring book for kids & adults or coloring book for adults- plural.  Lol  Plus it would work for kids if you can get over the grey scale nature of it.  Personally I\u2019m not going to waste expensive pens & paints trying to paint over the grey & black mess.  I grew up in SW Florida minutes from the beaches & I was really excited about the sea life in this. I hope the printers & designers figure out how to clean up the mess bc some of the designs are really cute. They just aren\u2019t worth my time to hand trace & transfer them, but I\u2019m sure there are ppl that will be up to the challenge.  This is one is a hard no. Going back.

If I wanted a fruit book I\u2019d have bought one!  These pages appear thinner too. You can see the images from the artwork on the other sides bleed through. I love the artist & her work, but I\u2019m very disappointed with this book. It\u2019s a measly 64 pages & 4 of the projects (the fruit) I will never paint in my lifetime.  There are so many animals she could have put in here like zebras, lions, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, alligators, crocodiles, & ostriches etc instead of the stupid fruit.  Poorly executed in book content & length, but lovely artwork on the good ones.  Not worth $23 ever imo.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Beautiful, but should only be printed on 1 side imo.", "text": "Seriously one of only a few books they I have ordered from Amazon that has arrived in pristine condition. No bent edges, no buckled covers, no marred printing, no mysterious liquids, & no folded pages. The book is lovely, but my continued pet peeve with books like this is the manufacturer\u2019s insistence of printing on both sides of the damned pages. So you can\u2019t frame one picture without losing the image on the other side. It\u2019s annoying.  I\u2019d gladly pay more for a book with printed images on only one side & on watercolor grade papers.  So instead I guess I will be yanking these out, scanning them, & printing them on my own watercolor papers so that I can use the images on both sides.  The paper just does not hold up to a lot of media of you choose to use both sides in my experience. Ever.  I believe I now own all, but one of JD books & I will be buying it for myself for Mother\u2019s Day. Lol. I love her art. I love her stamps. I love this book, but I\u2019m knocking a star bc printing on both sides is stupid imo when the book is meant to be used to create more art.  Why limit the artists by making us choose which side to use for framing or which side to use if we choose to cut one side up & decoupage it onto something. We are then paying double for half a book!  It\u2019s insane imo.
